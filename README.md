# Culture and Organization

## An Evolving Department
As part of an agile and focused department, it is important that we frequently review what is working, what is not, and what needs refinement. Below is an enumeration of how we work today, what is working, and some challenges that have been observed in the department over the years.

## Current State
The engineering organization at OSIsoft has historically been one of the more stable departments with respect to hiring and attrition. When we bring someone into the department, they join a team and we expect that they will stay on that team for several years. Over that tenure, we expect that they will gradually learn skills and grow as the prodcut matures. 

At the end of 2017, we created a new Product department under Gregg Le Blanc's management. The creation of this new department allowed engineering to focus on core development related activities while also contibuting to communication challenges and distributed accountability for product delivery. The engineering department has effectively been split into two functional groups: Product Definition and Software Development.

As we enter 2018, we are on the verge of delivering major new capabilities to the PI System. These new capabilities will not just incrementally add to the existing system but are planned as major new value and revenue generating components. Some of these capabilities will be delivered as SaaS offerings, some as Enterprise software components, and some as OEM offerings at the edge. 

## Challenges
### Expanded Portfolio
Along with new delivery patterns come new development, operations, and support challenges. All these factors represent a significant delta to the role of a developer at OSIsoft.

### Portfolio Agility
As technology evolves, markets change and our products have to mature. As products mature, we need to rebalance our priorities so that we are making smart investments. Instead of slowing down, we can expect the rate of change to increase and we need to be ready to respond effectively.

### Team Silos
This growth process can be somewhat haphazard and sometimes frustrating for the individual and the manager. Throughout the engineering department, onboarding processes are also unique to each team and prone to atrophy if the team isn't in a growth phase. Similar to onboarding, development tooling and processes vary wildly between teams. In some cases, this is understandable and deliberate where we have products written in different languages or targeting different primary personas. In most cases, however, these differences arise from a lack of oversight and a focus on consistency. This makes it increasingly difficult for individuals to move between teams and feel productive. We've heard that, in extreme cases, moving between teams is akin to joining a new company.

### Transparency
It can sometimes be difficult to understand who makes a decision or how that decision has been made. In some cases, it's even difficult to ascertain that a deliberate decision has been made at all.

## Opportunity for Improvement
### Professional Development
The engineering department needs to develop and deliver the very best products and services. To accomplish this, we need to continue to attract and retain the best talent. This increasingly means creating more opportunities for growth within the department. This doesn't necessarily mean creating titles or hierarchy but rather creating opportunities to learn new skills and taking on roles with well-ascribed responsbilities.

We want employees to feel empowered to make deicisons and equally confident that they are making decisions commensurate to their level of perspective. We want to support highly autonomous and creative teams. At the same time, we also want to reuse technology and focus on solving new problems.

Some roles will unavoidably become more specialized as a necessary side effect of scaling the department. As we create boundaries, it is important that we focus on communication, so individuals or groups don't become isolated and disenfranchised. As we redefine roles and career tracks, it is important that we communicate broadly any responsbilities and opportunities that arise.
